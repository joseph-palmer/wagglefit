# Abstract

Honeybee foraging is an extraordinary collective behaviour that is directed through the celebrated waggle dance communication system, whereby colony foraging effort is allocated through a series of feedback loops [@Frisch1993; @Seeley1995]. Here, we present a mathematical model that quantifies the extent to which honeybee colonies behave collectively in different ecological environments by inferring the proportion of dances performed by bees that have explored individually, and those that have been recruited to food sources. By applying this methodology to waggle dance data from twenty hives, we show that colonies are less reliant on dance information where resources are sparse, potentially because colonies are required to send out more scouts to find food in these circumstances. Our methodology provides a tool to identify those ecological conditions in which honeybee colonies rely on dance communication, and so to understand the selection pressures that may have driven the evolution of this remarkable collective behaviour.

# Main

Within honeybee colonies, a series of simple rules that determine when and how much bees perform the celebrated waggle dance (Figure of dance waggle dance) mean that choices between feeding sites occur at the level of the group rather than the individual. For example, because the number of dance circuits performed by a bee on returning from a food source reflects the net energetic benefits of the trip, more of the colony's workforce will be recruited to the sweeter of two equidistant sources [@Seeley1991], or the closer of two equally sweet sources [@Hasenjager2022], without requiring any individual bee to compare options. This extraordinary system is a key example of how social insect colony behaviour can take on a form extending beyond that of the individual units [@Sumpter2006].

Despite such impressive complexity, a wealth of research now shows that foraging bees frequently do not use dance information to find forage sites [@Gruter2009]. Accordingly, in many situations, colonies that are prevented from communicating via dances achieve equal or even greater foraging success than their wild-type counterparts [@Sherman2002; @Dornhaus2006; @Gruter2013; @Price2019]. This apparent variation in the use of collective behaviour is intriguing because it may provide clues as to those ecological selection pressures that were critical in the evolution of the dance communication system. Despite the extraordinary amount of research interest that has focused on the proximate mechanisms of collective decision-making via dance communication, the ultimate evolutionary drivers of its unique evolution within *Apis* -unparalleled in even a single other social insect- remain obscure [@Price2015]. Identifying those circumstances in which bees use the dance is likely to be a key step towards understanding when it is likely to afford fitness benefits at the colony level, but attempts to do so are challenging because they require constant monitoring of real-world colony weight [@Kirchner1998; @Sherman2002; @Dornhaus2006; @Gruter2013; @Nurnberger2017; @Price2019] -a noisy proxy of foraging success that is influenced by many other abiotic and biotic factors, including colony health- over ecologically credible time periods [@Schurch2014]. To do this at a scale that allows inter-colony variation in foraging environments at sufficient replication is a major logistical hurdle (but see [@Nurnberger2017]).

Honeybees provide an ideal study system in which to evaluate collective foraging thanks to the famous “waggle dance”, which conveys information about location of a resource as a vector of distance (duration of the waggle run) and direction (angle of the dance relative to the sun) [@Frisch1993].Through the observation and decoding of the waggle dance, a colony's dance floor provides a unique opportunity to eavesdrop on the communication and decision making leading to collective foraging decisions. Resource “quality” is provided through the number of waggle runs performed [@Frisch1993; @Boch1956; @Esch1961; @Seeley1994; @Seeley2000]). Although bees that follow dances do not specifically interpret this information on an individual level [@Seeley1991], the resulting over-representation of high-quality sites on the dance-floor means that they are more likely to encounter dances that advertise better forage [@Seeley1995], and provides the colony with a mechanism to select the most profitable resources in their environment [@Seeley1994A].

**End Box 1**

Here, we present a a model that can identify the proportion of foraging trips that are made by bees recruited through waggle dances, and thus quantify collective behaviour, in unmanipulated hives with no requirement to manipulate hive orientations or assay foraging efficiency. Our model seeks to distinguish between “scout” foraging trips, in which food sources that have been located through individual search are reported by waggle dancing, and “recruit” trips in which a forage site is found by using the information provided in the dance of another bee [@Seeley1995]. Scouting and recruiting are not fixed behavioural categories, because individual bees can engage in both over the course of their foraging lifetime, and foragers can dance on return from any successful trip irrespective of whether they were recruited to the forage site or found it individually [@Beekman2007]. In a hypothetical colony that relied only on individual search to find foraging sites, all trips would be “scout” trips, but as recruitment becomes more important, the proportion of “recruit” trips will increase. Previously, scout and recruit trips have only been distinguishable by means of the foragers’ individual search history, which requires following individual bees and is time and labour intensive [@Seeley1995].

To reveal how the patterns of waggle dance encoded foraging distances might differ under a scout and recruit foraging strategy, we simulated honeybees foraging in a landscape where resource patches were randomly placed in the environment. Foragers could locate these under two different strategies: either acting as a scout and locating resources themselves, or following a recruit strategy and locating resources by following a random dance from the dance floor [@Seeley1992] (Fig. 1). As it is known in the simulation which individuals forage under what strategy, we can compare the distributions of foraging distances reported on the dance floor. Figs 1c and 1d show that the shapes of the resource distance distributions for the two types of foraging trips are very different. The distance distribution of the scouts is akin to that of an exponential distribution (Fig. 1 C), which is the nearest neighbour distance distribution for foragers operating in a one-dimensional environment (see methods). The distribution of the distances reported by recruits (Fig. 1 D) is a Rayleigh distribution which is the nearest-neighbour distribution of a two-dimensional environment [@Pyke1978] (see Methods).

Scouts and recruits create different waggle run distributions on the dance-floor. These different distributions can be used to quantify the relative importance of collective foraging. Scouting foragers report a distribution of distances that reflects their probability of encountering a resource in the environment (see methods), whilst recruits report distances that reflect the distribution of the most profitable resources available (see methods). On the dance-floor, the distribution of distances is modified through the number of runs performed for a resource, which depends on the profitability of a resource, which honeybees achieve by measuring the energetic efficiency of a foraging trip through the ratio of energetic gain to energetic cost [@Seeley1994A]. By combining this profitability with the distributions identified in our simulations, we develop a novel method to describe the distribution of waggle runs reported on the dance-floors of real honeybee colonies as a superposition of scout and recruit distributions (Fig 2, see Methods).

This method intrinsically captures honeybee foraging as collective decision making, as the foraging sites represented on the dance floor derive from a mixture of individual search and waggle dance information, captured in the proportions $p$ and $1-p$, respectively. Consequently, by setting $p = 1$, we can also derive a model based on the sole use of individual search (scouts only) (Fig 2). By fitting these two models to distribution of waggle run durations decoded from real honeybee colonies we are thus able, using model selection [@Burnham2002], to infer if and, by estimating the parameter $p$, to what extent honeybee colonies use waggle dance information when foraging.

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 2: Model of honey bee foraging. Flowers advertised by scouts are distributed exponentially (a). These dances are advertised on the dance floor (b) in relation to their profitability, meaning sampling recruits are biased to the more profitable (and closer) resources (c). After visiting advertised resources, recruits also dance for them leading to higher recruitment (d) which overall skews the distribution of distances reported on the entire dance floor (e)."}

To evaluate the use of waggle dance information and individual search in honeybee colonies foraging in 'natural' landscapes, we analysed a pre-existing dataset of 3378 waggle dance observations from 20 observation hives, recorded between April-September 2017, (previously described in [@Samuelson2021]). Hives that contributed to this dataset had been situated at different locations in South East England (see methods, figure 3A) and visited every two weeks for a period of 24 weeks. On each visit, two hours of continuous waggle dance data was recorded by training a camcorder onto the dance floor. The footage of the dances was decoded manually [@Couvillon2012; @Schurch2019] to extract waggle run durations. Using this data, for each site we fit both the collective and individual models and used model selection to determine which provided the better explanation of the data, and (if the collective model provided a better fit) to quantify the relative use of social information through estimating the parameter p. We calculated the goodness-of-fit using a Kolmorgorov-Smirnov (KS) test to ascertain if the model provided a plausible explanation of the data [@Goldstein2004].

For 17 out of 20 study hives, a model of collective foraging provided a better explanation of the data than one of individual foraging (Fig. 3a). In all but one of these cases, the collective model had a good fit (using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, see methods) to the empirical waggle run durations, whereas for 9 of these sites, the distribution predicted by the scout model was significantly different to the observed data (Fig. 3b). The sites shown in Figs 3c-d are representative examples showing the model fits, showing the overall quality of the model fit to the data.

These results show that, whilst colony-level foraging is mostly comprised of a mixture of scout and recruit foraging trips, in some circumstances, colony foraging can be better described by individual foraging alone. This suggests that in some environments honey bees mainly engage in scouting to find new food sites rather than follow dances. Previous empirical studies have shown that individual foragers may flexibly alter their use of waggle dance information if its use is proving unproductive [@Gruter2011; @Price2019]. Evaluating how these individual decisions influence the collective, however, has historically been a challenge as it is effectively impossible to track an individual's foraging behaviour over a landscape. As our results show that individual foraging accurately describes colony foraging in three different sites, these findings support the idea that individual decision making can dominate colony foraging and demonstrates further evidence for flexible waggle dance use by honey bee colonies.

Further quantification of the use of waggle-dance recruitment within all colonies, as a proportion of all foraging trips, can be achieved by extracting the estimated proportion of scout trips (p) for each site. Since our sites varied in land-use characteristics and potentially thus forage distributions (although in this case, not by design for this study), we investigated whether these estimates might correlate with land-use. We first classified the different land-use types of the area surrounding each site [@Samuelson2018] to obtain a standardised land-use profile for the urban and agri-rural environments separately as many land-use types present in urban areas do not occur in agri-rural environments and vice versa (see methods). We then performed a Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis [@Carrascal2009] (see methods) to determine the principal components that represent combinations of land-use types which explained the most variation in the proportion of scout dances within agri-rural and urban environments. As we have a small sample size (20 sites; 10 urban and 10 agri-rural), this analysis was jackknifed to evaluate the robustness of our results to influential points (see methods, supplementary material section _._)

In the agri-rural environments one combination of land use types explained ~52% of the variation in the proportion of scouts (beta regression: $R^2 = 0.52$, $\phi$ = 3.7, p < 0.05, Fig. 4. A). This principal component correlates positively with arable land (29% of land coverage; Table 1) and negatively with built-up areas (17% of land coverage) ; it also correlates negatively with non-agricultrual unmanaged green space and water , but together these represent less than 3% of land-use (Fig. 4. B). These land-use types maintain a significant correlation with PC1 over the jackknifed PLS (Fig. 4. B) indicating the results are robust. As arable land increases whilst built-up areas decrease, the proportion of trips that are driven by individual search increases.

A similar effect was observed in the urban environment, where a single PC explained ~59% of the variance in the proportion of scouts (beta regression: $R^2$ = 0.59, $\phi$ = 6.2, p < 0.05, Fig. 5. A). This PC correlates positively with parks, allotments and cemeteries (8% of land cover; Table 2), whilst correlating negatively with sparse residential lands (35% of land cover) and railways but these represent only 1% of land cover. (Fig. 5. B). However, we have low confidence in this finding because the jackknifed PLS identifies CAD as a highly influential site, the removal of which causes sparse residential land to have a positive correlation with PC1 (Supplementary Material _._).

Across both environments our results hint at a decrease in reliance on waggle dance recruitment as resources become harder to find and foraging trips become longer [@Samuelson2021]. Arable land is likely to be nutritionally poor for pollinators (note that oilseed rape field and fruit crops were not included in this category), while residential areas -particularly gardens- are considered nutritional hotspots for bees [@Baldock2019]. Similarly, in the urban environments sparse-residential coverage correlated negatively with the proportion of scout trips. However, we are cautious in this interpretation for two reasons. Firstly, because our study was designed as a proof-of-principle based on an existing dataset, we did not systematically assess the availability of forage within these sites. Secondly, although we saw a similar pattern in the urban data for sparse residential areas (35% of land-cover), which correlated negatively with the proportion of scout trips, this pattern reversed when a highly influential site (CAD; identified by the jacknifed PLS) was removed, and we also found parks, allotments and cemeteries (8% land cover), which could be expected to provide abundant forage for bees [@Baldock2019], to correlate positively with independent search.

The fitting of our model to waggle dance observations provides a novel tool to quantify the relative importance of social and private information in honeybees. Whilst recruitment is well known to occur through other mechanisms besides the waggle dance, such as through olfactory cues, the exceptionally close fit of our model to waggle run durations underlines the importance of the waggle dance in honey bee foraging. Further, by identifying the land-use combinations which most influence variation in the proportion of scouts, our analysis allows us to map the environment along the major axis of honeybee information use and visualise how land-use influences the use of the waggle dance.

Our results within the agri-rural sites are in broad agreement with other studies which evaluated foraging performance with and without the dance [@Dornhaus2006; Price2019]. These results suggest that, even though collective foraging is not always beneficial, that in environments where high quality resources are present, but relatively scarce, collective foraging is being carried out by colonies, suggesting that under these conditions exchanging social information through the waggle dance confers benefits. These benefits of dancing appear to outweigh the costs associated with dancing and could explain why this remarkable behaviour is present in modern-day bees. However, the results for our urban sites do not produce a clear biological rational and present an all together more varied picture. An alternative hypothesis could be that the the dance is influenced by resource stability more than abundance and that longer term effects may contribute to the benefits of the dance [@Schurch2014]. Whilst the limiting number of sites used in this study handicaps our ability to progress this debate here, as a proof of concept, the methods derived here provide a new toolkit for evaluating factors influencing waggle dance recruitment

The analysis of waggle dance data can make an important contribution to our understanding of social information use and provides a methodology to further evaluate how honey bees use their unique dance language. Recently, technological advances have emerged which enable colony metrics to be collected faster, more accurately and over greater time spans than could be gathered by hand, allowing individuals to be tracked within colonies and theories of individual behaviour to be evaluated in more depth than could have been done previously [@Wild2021]. By piecing together the behavioural response of individuals and combining these with landscape analyses, we have found a mathematical description of colony foraging which extends our ability to predict individual behaviour beyond the colony walls and in to the environment. With the advances in the decoding of the waggle dance through automated methods [@Wario2017], we face the prospect of waggle dance data becoming “big data”. Our methodology thus provides a means of analysing such large data sets to inform the debate about the importance of social information, as well as providing useful colony metrics of foraging activity.
